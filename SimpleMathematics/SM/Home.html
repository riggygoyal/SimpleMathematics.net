        <p>
            This website is designed to help students understand
            mathematical concepts and to encourage students to enjoy doing math.

        <h1>Why is mathematics so important? </h1>
        <p>

            Even though certain concepts might be difficult to understand and tedious to do,
            all this math has real-world use, especially if you plan to be an engineer
            or plan to go into a technical field of some sort. For example, area and volume calculations play an important role in
            designing of buildings. If you do any sort of finances, it is extremely important to learn about percentages. Even complex trigonometry
            has it's place if you need to use physics.
