        <h1>Multiplication</h1>
        <p>
            Multiplication is one of the four basic operations of mathematics. Multiplication is based on Addition since it involves taking
            a number and adding it multiple times. Multiplication is represented with either a "x" or "*" sign and the answer to a multiplication problem is refered to as
            a product. An example of a multiplication problem is "2x3" or "2*3". This multiplication problem means that the number 2
            is being added 3 times, or "2+2+2". It can also be reversed to 3x2, which means adding 3 twice, or "3+3". Either way, your answer is 6, since the order of the number doesn't matter
            in multiplication.
            <br />
            <br />
            Small multiplication problems may seem easy enough, but this process can become very hard with big numbers.
            For example, 24x18 is not a problem you can easily turn into an addition problem, since making it an addition problem requires adding "24" 18 times, or the other way
            around. For bigger numbers like these, we can use long multiplication methods to solve for the product. There are multiple ways of doing this, such as the "lattice multiplication"
            method. However, for this example we will do the traditional long multiplication method. We will use the before mentioned 24 and 18 numbers as an example.
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 1.jpeg"
                 alt="Multiplication 1" />
            <br />
            Before we do anything we have to get one thing clear: multiplication is not done is the same order as
            addition and subtraction. In long addition and subtraction, you go column by column from right to left. In multiplication,
            the order is a little more complex. First you have to look at the bottom number. In this case, the bottom number is 18.
            Then, you have to start with the first digit on the right, which is 8.
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 2.jpg"
                 alt="Multiplication 2" />
            <br />
            Now what we do is take that number and multiply it by 24 step by step. First we start by multiplying it by 4.
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 3.jpg"
                 alt="Multiplication 3" />
            <br />
            8x4 is equal to 32. If you get a single digit number (0-9) you can write that at the bottom and move to the next step. However, we got a double digit number, so we have to carry
            the number, which is a very similar process to carrying in long addition. You right 2 on the bottom and then write 3 on top of the 2 to carry the number, like so:
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 4.jpg"
                 alt="Multiplication 4" />
            <br />

            Now instead of moving on to the next column, we keep using 8 and multiply it by 2, which gives us 16.
            Since 2 is the last digit on the top number, we can't carry the 1 in 16. So we take 16, add it to the 3 we carried over from before,
            and we get 19. We write that on the bottom.
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 5.jpg"
                 alt="Multiplication 5" />
            <br />
            Now we're halfway through! We have essentially split this problem into two parts, 24x8 and 24x10. We just multiplied 8 by 24 and
            got 192. Now we're going to do the second part of this problem, 24x10. For now, take that 192 set it aside for now (you can write the rest of this problem below
            192 if you have space to do so).
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 6.jpg"
                 alt="Multiplication 6" />
            <br />
            Now we'll multiply the same way we did last time, except we're going to use the "1" digit instead of 8.
            While it looks like we're multiplying 24 by 1, we're actually multiplying 24 by 10 (since the 1 is in the tens digit).
            So to account for that extra 0, we'll start of by writing a 0 as the first digit.
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 7.jpg"
                 alt="Multiplication 7" />
            <br />
            Now we'll do the actual multiplication. First we take 1 and multiply it by 4, since its the first digit on the right. We get 4 and write it
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 8.jpg"
                 alt="Multiplication 8" />
            <br />
            Now we go left and multiply 1 and 2, which simply gives us 2.
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Multiplication 9.jpg"
                 alt="Multiplication 9" />
            <br />
            There you go! We completed 24x10 and got 240! It is useful to note that when multiplying any number times 10,
            100, 1000 etc. you can simply take your original number and add 0s to it (In this case, 10 has one zero, so we can just take 24, and add a 0 to it to make 240).
            <br />
            The final step is to add our two numbers together. 192+240 is equal to 432 (you can even try long addition on this for practice), so 432 is our final answer!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1>Division</h1>
            <p>
                Division is the opposite of multiplication. Unlike multiplication, where you take a number and add it over and over again to make it bigger,
                division involves breaking down a number into parts. For example, 10 divided by 5 is 2 because dividing 10 of something into 5 parts gives you 2 per part. For example,
                dividing 10 cookies for 5 people means each person gets 2. Division is also reversible, meaning that 10 divided by 2 gives you 5. Just like all of our operations so far,
                division has a long method that requires several steps. For this example, we will use 200 divided by 16.
                <br />
                <br />
                Division has multiple symbols. One symbol is <a href="https://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=AwrEwM8ji5ha3hwAoi6JzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTBsZ29xY3ZzBHNlYwNzZWFyY2gEc2xrA2J1dHRvbg--;_ylc=X1MDOTYwNjI4NTcEX3IDMgRhY3RuA2NsawRiY2sDZnVzMHFmdGQ1c2wxNCUyNmIlM0QzJTI2cyUzRG90BGNzcmNwdmlkA3ZxRXBGekV3TGpIX2NCcF9XbDVVSkFiYU1qWXdNUUFBQUFBaEhYNmcEZnIDbWNhZmVlBGZyMgNzYS1ncARncHJpZAN3d3FfTnNSTVRXR3lyUEpVX2NyeGxBBG10ZXN0aWQDbnVsbARuX3N1Z2cDMTAEb3JpZ2luA2ltYWdlcy5zZWFyY2gueWFob28uY29tBHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDBHFzdHJsAzE1BHF1ZXJ5A2RpdmlzaW9uIHN5bWJvbAR0X3N0bXADMTUxOTk0NjU0MwR2dGVzdGlkA251bGw-?gprid=wwq_NsRMTWGyrPJU_crxlA&pvid=vqEpFzEwLjH_cBp_Wl5UJAbaMjYwMQAAAAAhHX6g&p=division+symbol&fr=mcafee&fr2=sb-top-images.search.yahoo.com&ei=UTF-8&n=60&x=wrt">this</a>.
                Another way to show division is to seperate the 2 numbers in the division problem using a line, such as 10/2, or in our example, 200/16. But in long division, none of those symbols in used.
                Instead, a long division problem is set up like this:
                <br />
                <img class="exampleimg"
                     src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Division 1.jpeg"
                     alt="Division 1" />
                <br />
                The dividend (The big number that is getting divided) goes inside the "box". The divisor (the smaller number that is dividing the bigger number) goes on the outside.
                The quotient (The answer for a division problem) will go above the box, and we will write the quotient out number by number as we go along.
                <br />
                The first step is taking the first digits of the dividend and dividng them by the divisor. Unlike the other operations, we will be going left to right.
                In this case we will start with the first digit on the left, 2, and try to divide it by 16. Since 2 is too small to be divided by 16, we move to the next digit.
                The first and second digits of the dividend are 2 and 0, making 20. 20 is big enough to be divided by 16 at least once, so that's what we will use.
                <br />
                <img class="exampleimg"
                     src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Division 2.jpg"
                     alt="Division 2" />
                <br />
                Now we divide 20 by 16. How many times does 16 go into 20? It can only go in once, so we right 1 on the top.
                <br />
                <img class="exampleimg"
                     src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Division 3.jpg"
                     alt="Division 3" />
                <br />
                Now we make a little subtraction problem below the 20. Since we know 16 can only go into 20 one time, we take 16 times 1
                (which is obviously 16) and right that below the 20 and make a subtraction problem.
                <br />
                <img class="exampleimg"
                     src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Division 4.jpg"
                     alt="Division 4" />
                <br />
                20-16 gives us 4. The answer you get from this little subtraction problem should be smaller
                than the divisor (for us, 4 is smaller than 16, so we are alright). If the number you get is bigger than the divisor,
                that means your divisor can go into the original number another time. Because we got 4, we know 16 can only go into 20 once because 4
                is too small of a number to put 16 into again. With that being said we move on to the next step. After subtracting and getting your number,
                you bring down the next digit of the divisor. For us, our next digit is that last 0 because we already used the first two digits. We bring that last 0 down like so:
                <br />
                <img class="exampleimg"
                     src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Division 5.jpg"
                     alt="Division 5" />
                <br />
                Now this number should be bigger than the divisor because we are going to divide this number again. For us, 40 is bigger than 16, which means it is big enough for us to divide. If your number is less than 16 after bringing down a digit,
                put a 0 in the quiotient as a place holder and bring down another digit. Now that we have 40, we can divide this number by 16. 16 goes into 40 two times,
                because 2 times 16 is 32 and is the biggest number we can fit into 40 without going over 40. So we write a 2 in the quotient and set up a subtraction problem just
                like we did the first time.
                <br />
                <img class="exampleimg"
                     src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Division 6.jpg"
                     alt="Division 6" />
                <br />
                
                <img class="exampleimg"
                     src="/Images/Multiplication and Division/Division 7.jpg"
                     alt="Division 7" />
                <br />
                Now we have 12 in the quotient and 8 on the bottom. We know we're ok right now because 8 is too small of a number to be divided by 16.
                Now this is where you have multiple options. Since we don't have any more digits to bring down, this is technically our final answer. 16 can go into 200 12 times
                with a remainder of 8. The remainder is the final number you have left over. For us, we had a remainder of 8. This essentially means that if there were 200 cookies that 16 children shared,
                all of the kids would have 12 cookies, and there would be 8 left over. Now we can either leave the answer as is, or we can go further and make this into a decimal or fraction. Since we haven't learned about fractions or decimals,
                we'll just leave the problem how it is. In the next section you'll understand what fractions and decimals are and what you would do to really finish this problem.
