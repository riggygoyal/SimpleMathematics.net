        <h1>Addition</h1>
        <p>
            Addition is one of four basic operations in math.
            Addition simply involves taking one amount or number, and
            combining it with another. To write an addition problem, you use the "+"
            symbol to show that the two numbers
            are being added together, and the answer to any addition problem is
            refered to as a "sum". The best way to set up big addition problems is to
            stack them up and line up each digit from right to left, like so:
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Addition1.jpeg"
                       alt="Addition 1" />
            <br />
            Once you stack your numbers, start from the right and add each digit from top to bottom .
            In this case the first 2 digits on the right are "1" on the top and "9" on the bottom so we add those
            first.
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Addition 2.jpg"
                       alt="Addition 2" />
            <br />
            When we add 1 and 9, we get 10. If you get a single digit number (from 0-9),
            you can just write the number and move on. However, if you get a 2 digit number like we did,
            you have to "carry the number". This means you write the first digit, which in this case is "0",
            on the bottom. Then you take the second digit, which in this case is a "1", and put it on top of the next column,
            like so:
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Addition 3.jpg"
                       alt="Addition 3" />
            <br />
            After you add the first column of numbers, you move on to the next column on the left.
            Here, you do the same thing you did in the first column. Take all the numbers in the column and
            add them together. In this case we have a "2", a "1", and another "1" that we carried from earlier.
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Addition 4.jpg"
                       alt="Addition 4" />
            <br />
            When you add 1, 1, and 2, you get 4. Since this number is only a single digit number,
            you can just write "4" on the bottom and move on to the last column without carrying a number.
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Addition 5.jpg"
                       alt="Addition 5" />
            <br />
            In the last column, the only number is a "1". Since there are no other numbers to add,
            you can just take that 1 and move it to the bottom.
            <br /><img img class="exampleimg"

                       alt="Addition 6" />
            <br />
            Tadaa! You have your answer! The final sum to this problem is 140. This method can be used on
            any addition problem. You can practice doing this yourself by making up any numbers and trying to add them together.
            <br />

        <h1>Subtraction</h1>
        
        <p>
            Subtraction is the opposite of addition. Instead of combining two or more numbers together,
            subtraction involvers taking away numbers. If I have ten cookies and two of them get eaten, that situation would be set up as
            a subtraction problem. Subtraction problems use a "-" symbol. The answer to a subtraction problem is known as
            the "difference".
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Subtraction 1.jpeg"
                       alt="Subtraction 1" />
            <br />
            For this problem we will use "153" and "71". It is important to note that the order of the numbers
            makes a big difference in what your answer will be. In addition, you can add any two numbers in any order,
            but in subtraction, putting the "153-71" and "71-153" will give you different answers. For this example,
            we will use 153-71.
            <br />
            <br />
            Similar to addition, we will start on the right column and go left. Our first two numbers are
            3 and 1. When we subtract these we get 2, so we right that on the bottom and move to next column.
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Subtraction 2.jpg"
                       alt="Subtraction 2" />
            <br />
            Now in the next column our numbers are 5 and 7.
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Subtraction 3.jpg"
                       alt="Subtraction 3" />
            <br />
            Here's where things get interesting. Since we have to go from top to bottom, we have to do
            "5-7". However, 5-7 gives us a negative number, meaning that the number is less than 0 (we talk about negative and positive numbers in a later section).
            We shouldn't get a number below 0 however, since 153-71 is supposed to give us a number greater then 0. In this case, we need to do something known as
            "borrowing". To borrow a number, you look at the number on the left, which in this case is 1.
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Subtraction 4.jpg"
                       alt="Subtraction 4" />
            <br />
            Take that number take away 1 from it and move it to the right. In this case, we take 1 away from 1
            (which gives us 0) and put that 1 on 5 to make it 15, like so:
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Subtraction 5.jpg"
                       alt="Subtraction 5" />
            <br />
            Now we have 15-7 instead of 5-7, and we can subtract them to get a positive number. 15-7 is 8, so we write that on the bottom
            and move on.
            <br /><img class="exampleimg"
                       src="/Images/Addition and Subtraction/Subtraction 6.jpg"
                       alt="Subtraction 6" />
            <br />
            Since the very last column only has a "0", we can leave that alone. Now you've completed a long subtraction problem! 
            The difference of 153 and 71 is 82. Just like with addition problems, you can do this with any numbers, just make sure to the bigger number first if you
            don't want to get a negative answer.
