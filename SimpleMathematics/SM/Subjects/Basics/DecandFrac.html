        <h1>Fractions and Decimals</h1>
        <p>
          Fractions and decimals open up a whole new world in mathematics since they allow numbers to be even smaller
            and more specific then the whole numbers we know right now. Fractions and Decimals represent numbers that
            are between two whole numbers, like 0 and 1. We know numbers go from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 and so on. But what about numbers between these whole numbers?
            For example, what comes between 0 and 1? What comes between 1 and 2? What if I want to represent a part of a cake, like a half of a cake. Half of a cake is less than
            1 whole cake, but it's also more than having 0, or no cake at all. How do we represent this in numbers? That's what we are here to learn.

        <h1>Fractions</h1>
        <p>
            Fractions are very interesting an very helpful in the world of mathematics. They can help us by setting up remainders in division problems or with numbers smaller
            than 1. Fractions are basically like division problems, except they are represented differently than long division problems.
            Fractions are represented using a line like these:
            <br />
            <img class="exampleimg"
                 src="/Images/Fractions and Decimals/Fraction 1.jpeg"
                 alt="Fraction 1" />
            <br />
            The line is a simple way to represent fractions and division. The number on the top or left (in this case being x) is called the "numerator". The
            numerator is the number that is being divided, or the dividend. The bottom number (in this case being y) is the "denominator". The denominator is the
            divisor, or the number that the dividend is being divided by. Another way to think about this is that the numerator (x) would be the number on the
            inside of the "box" that is being divided while the denominator (y) would be the number outside of the outside in a long division problem. In this picture,
            x is being divided by y.
            <br />
            So how exactly does this help us when we are trying to make numbers smaller than 1? Well let's think about a cake or a pie. We'll use a circle diagram to represent our cake.
            1 whole cake is represented by a full circle, like so:
